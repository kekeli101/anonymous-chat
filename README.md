# Anonymous Chat Application

## Overview
This is a simple real-time anonymous chat application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. Users can create or join chat rooms, send messages, and chat anonymously with others in the same room. The person who creates the room becomes the "admin" and has the ability to close the room, which disconnects all users.

---

## Features
1. **Create Room**: Users can create a new chat room with a unique 6-digit room key.
2. **Join Room**: Users can join an existing room by entering the 6-digit room key.
3. **Anonymous Usernames**: Each user is assigned a random, anonymous username (e.g., `Red-Lion-Apple`).
4. **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time within the room.
5. **Admin Controls**: The room creator (admin) can close the room, which disconnects all users.
6. **Responsive UI**: The application has a clean and responsive user interface.

## How It Works

### 1. **Create a Room**
- Click the **"Create Room"** button on the greeting page.
- A unique 6-digit room key is generated and displayed.
- The user becomes the admin of the room and is automatically joined into the room.
- The admin can start chatting or close the room at any time.

### 2. **Join a Room**
- Click the **"Join Room"** button on the greeting page.
- Enter the 6-digit room key provided by the room admin.
- If the room exists, the user is assigned a random username and joined into the room.
- The user can start chatting with others in the room.

### 3. **Send Messages**
- Once in the chat room, users can type messages in the input box and press **Enter** or click the **Send** button.
- Messages are broadcasted to all users in the room in real-time.

### 4. **Close Room (Admin Only)**
- The admin can click the **"Close Room"** button to close the room.
- All users in the room are disconnected and redirected to the greeting page.

## Code Overview

### 1. **Server-Side (`server.js`)**
- Uses **Express** to serve static files and handle routes.
- Uses **Socket.IO** for real-time communication.
- Manages rooms and users using `Map` objects.
- Generates random room keys and usernames.

### 2. **Client-Side (`script.js`)**
- Handles user interactions (create room, join room, send messages).
- Listens for Socket.IO events (`new-message`, `room-closed`).
- Updates the UI dynamically based on server responses.

### 3. **Frontend (`index.html` and `styles.css`)**
- Provides a clean and responsive user interface.
- Uses CSS animations for message display.
